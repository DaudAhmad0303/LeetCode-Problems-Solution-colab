# LeetCode Problems Solution COLAB

In the above Notebooks, partice of leetcode problems are executed.

I first try to run the [leetcode](https://leetcode.com) problems in **Google COLAB** for clarificationand and then submit it. *LeetCode_Problems.ipynb* was getting large and large so I've created a new One *LeetCode_Problems_1.ipynb*.

Following Links can be used to open these Notebooks in Google COLAB and you can run these as well iff you're signed in your google account:
